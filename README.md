## üìÇ Featured Projects:

### üî¨ Biological Computation
   - **[Genetic Algorithm - Methuselah Patterns](https://github.com/v1t3ls0n/GeneticAlgorithm-MethuselahPatterns)**  
      A genetic algorithm implementation designed to discover Methuselah patterns in Conway's Game of Life. Methuselah patterns are small initial configurations that evolve for many generations before stabilizing.  
      **Highlights**:  
      - Explored evolutionary approaches to optimize and analyze pattern behavior.  
      - Integrated visualization tools to study dynamic evolution in real-time.  
      **Keywords**: Genetic Algorithm, Conway's Game of Life, Methuselah Patterns, Computational Biology.

   - **[Cellular Automaton](https://github.com/v1t3ls0n/Cellular-Automaton)**  
      A simulation of cellular automata developed as part of the Biological Computation course. This project explores emergent behaviors in systems and their applications, such as modeling environmental and climate-based models.  
      **Highlights**:  
      - Designed custom automata rules for advanced simulations.  
      - Utilized Python with Tkinter for visualization and statistical analysis of system dynamics.
